		<p class="Align"> Hello My name is Leeomar Flores. I am a current student at Illinois state university. I am majoring in game design and hoping to one day make my own game company and make tripple A games. I've alwasys loved videogames since I was little starting back on a sega my mother used to own. Every since I was little I was curious as to how they were made. After finding out you could make money for creating games I knew that it was something I needed to do.
